To try this, you have to download the weights from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights and then put them in this base directory.

Then run yolomodel.py to save the model in .h5 and then yolomodeltest.snn to run the snn simulation

Currently not working!

The model is copied from https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/

which itself is based on https://github.com/experiencor/keras-yolo3
